# RegexMastery
Regular expression building and testing tool in .NET

A tool which allows you to quickly build and test your regular expressions in .NET

1. Enter some text sample
2. Build your regex
3. Choose common flags
4. Optionally, add text replacement

The tool automatically evaluates the regular expression against sample text and shows the outcome. 

It also shows all detected matches and groups within each match so you can see how to best use Regex.Matches and Match.Groups objects in your .NET application.

If you've provided text replacement, then it shows the replaced text instead.
